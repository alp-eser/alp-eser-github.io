shortDescription: I designed a residential building project located in a suburban area where families have a tradition of living together even after their children are married. To accommodate the changing times, I designed houses with separated floors that still felt like one house per family. The design included space for animals and parking, as well as a sustainable design approach that considered the environment. The result is a functional and modern residential building that honors the traditional values of the community.
