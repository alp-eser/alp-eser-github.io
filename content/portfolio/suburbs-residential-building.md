shortDescription: I designed a residential building project located in a suburban area where families have a tradition of living together even after their children are married. To accommodate the changing times, I designed houses with separated floors that still felt like one house per family. The design included space for animals and parking, as well as a sustainable design approach that considered the environment. The result is a functional and modern residential building that honors the traditional values of the community.
challenge: A residential building was designed in a suburban area with the challenge of accommodating families who have a tradition of living together.
solution: The solution involved designing separate floors for each family to provide privacy while still allowing them to live together. The design also incorporated space for animals and parking, as well as sustainable features such as green spaces.
