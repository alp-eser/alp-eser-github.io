shortDescription: an urban area that combines modern design with functionality. The design takes into consideration the sun path to ensure that each house receives sufficient natural light during the day while preventing cold wind from entering the building. In addition to the residential buildings, the urban area includes bicycle roads and a safe environment for children to play. The compound includes ample parking spots and an interactive square for residents to gather and engage with each other. Overall, the design is a practical and aesthetically pleasing solution that meets the needs of the community.
