shortDescription: I designed a residential building in the historical area of Al-Fateh Samatya, Turkey. The project presented unique challenges as the design had to comply with government rules due to the illegal construction of the original buildings in the area. My goal was to preserve historical buildings as they are, while creating a modern residential building that reflects the previous culture of the area. The design incorporates the area's style and culture, while the interior design was carefully crafted for a modern touch. The result is a successful blend of the past and present, with a functional and aesthetically pleasing residential building that honors the historical significance of the area.
