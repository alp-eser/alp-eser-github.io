shortDescription: Government building on a sloped land using a metal shelter structure system. Challenges such as stability, retaining walls, and drainage were addressed in the design, along with features such as ramps and elevators for accessibility. To convey the authority of the government, the building included design elements such as a grand entrance, impressive columns, and a muted color scheme. The building's security features included security cameras, restricted access areas, and secure detention cells. Overall, the project resulted in a functional, secure, and accessible building that met the needs of the public while being built on a challenging sloped site.
challenge: Building on a sloped land presents challenges in terms of stability, retaining walls, drainage, and accessibility.
solution: he solutions to these challenges include using a metal shelter structure system for stability, careful engineering of retaining walls using reinforced concrete, designing effective drainage systems, and incorporating ramps and elevators for accessibility.
